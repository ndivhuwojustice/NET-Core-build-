Workflow steps (high-level):
Checkout repo
Setup Node.js and Java (JDK 11+)
Install/run bubblewrap to generate the Android project
Build the AAB (Gradle bundle)
Ensure there's an upload keystore (either generated by CI or provided via secret)
Sign the AAB with keystore
Authenticate to Google Play using a Play service account JSON (secret PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON)
Upload the signed AAB to Google Play using a Google Play uploader action
Optionally upload the AAB as a workflow artifact
